# A mediocre purely mod-based D2:R loot filter

This probably will not get you banned as it strictly uses the game's modding support, without relying on injection or hooks. That said, Blizzard has banned for MPQ edits in the past -- breakpoint hacking, farcast, etc. Use at your own risk.

# Installation

1. Download CascView from http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html
2. In CascView open storage and select your D2R folder
3. Once opened navigate to data/data. You should see three folders named global, hd, and local. Extract these folders into the D2R/Data folder. This will require around 30 GB of disk space. If done correctly your data folder will now look like https://i.imgur.com/HCRtp9G.png
4. Extract the loot filter files into your Data folder. When Windows prompts you, select overwrite all. If Windows does not prompt you to overwrite files, you fucked something up.
5. Edit your game shortcut to add -direct -txt to the end. If using battle.net launcher, you can set this in game properties. https://i.imgur.com/kgP3VFZ.png
6. Enjoy and hope Blizzard doesn't ban us ðŸ¥º
