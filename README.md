# A mediocre purely mod-based D2:R loot filter

This is a mod for D2R that makes it easier to quickly discern which items you would want to pick up, essentially implementing a pseudo loot filter.

# Disclaimer

Although this strictly uses the game's built in modding support, we do not know Blizzard's stance on using mods on battle.net. The nature of D2 modding means that only visual mods can be used online, which is what this mod is. If Blizzard were opposed to it I believe they'd disable modding support online entirely. If I receive a response or contact from a Blizzard employee, I will happily take down all copies of the mod. 

# Installation

1. Download the repo as a zip using the Code button at the top of the page
2. Create a directory in your D2 installation folder named "mods", copy the lootfilter directory into this folder. 
3. If done correctly, the directory layout should match https://i.imgur.com/hZAvJI6.png
4. Edit game settings in your battle.net launcher and add "-mod lootfilter -txt" to your parameters, https://i.imgur.com/LG9Fpn2.png
5. Launch the game and enjoy a more pleasant D2R experience ðŸ¥°

# FAQ

* It didn't install right -- not a question, but you did something wrong, refer to screenshots
* Can X/Y/Z be done? -- probably not, if you're looking for item rarity it isn't possible
* Does this slow down act switching? -- yes, if you use the -direct -txt method. Get a faster SSD or use the MPQ.
* How can I make edits? -- view the commit history on top of the page and read how I'm making changes.
* How do I edit MPQs? -- http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html
* My game crashes often, is it the loot filter? -- I run 5x clients, 1x loot filter 4x vanilla. All crash equally. Blame Blizzard.
