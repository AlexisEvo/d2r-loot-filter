# A mediocre purely mod-based D2:R loot filter

This is a mod for D2R that makes it easier to quickly discern which items you would want to pick up, essentially implementing a pseudo loot filter. Items cannot be filtered however you can edit the localization of text for every 'base' item. This means you can prevent all "Giant Axe" from cluttering the ground by setting an empty name but cannot filter normal <> unique. Also some names like greater health potion can be reduded to single characters. This will be extremely helpful for trav runs. You can also swap the text out so that it is larger or like in PD2 S1 make some items a large box to click.


# Installation

1. Download the repo as a zip using the Code button at the top of the page
2. Create a directory in your D2 installation folder named "mods", copy the lootfilter directory into this folder. 
3. If done correctly, the directory layout should match

* Can X/Y/Z be done? -- probably not, if you're looking for item rarity it isn't possible
* Does this slow down act switching? -- yes, if you use the -direct -txt method. Get a faster SSD or use the MPQ.
