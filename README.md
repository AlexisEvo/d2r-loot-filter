This project is dead. I've laid out the fundamentals for other D2R loot filter devs to do their things. This entire project is owned by Microsoft-Activision-Vivendi-Blizzard-VicariciousVissions-Condor-Silicon&Synapse-+somanymoreicantname

I've had the pleasure of meeting many Blizzard North devs that have worked on this game, and for most of them it was their passion project. Others cashed in on exploits to try to profit. I open myself to legal obligation for saying this, but fuck you rethek.
